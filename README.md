## About

This is a game made in Godot with C#, it actually is inspired from RimWorld and other games.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **Godot Engine**: Make sure you have the Godot Engine (C# version) installed. You can download it from [Godot's official website](https://godotengine.org/download).
- **NET 8.0**: Personally I use this version, but this depends on Godot (I think 6.0 onwards should work too).
- **Omnisharp**: I use the VSCode plugin (C#, not the latest C# dev kit). Mainly for linting. 

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tsukugi/RPGGodot.git
    ```
2. **Open the project in Godot**:
    - Launch Godot Engine.
    - Click on the "Import" button.
    - Browse to the directory where you cloned the repository.
    - Select the `test.godot` file and open it.
